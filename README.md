# Covid Death Prediction Objective
Given certain characteristics about an individual, can the machine predict if they would die due to COVID-19? 



***

# Approach

Random Forest Classifier ML program that uses CDC data to predict if patients would die given certain demographic data such as race, sex, age group, hospitalized yes or no, etc. 

Our group plans to filter the CDC data by first eliminating columns we do not want and then eliminating all rows that do not have complete information. 
We plan to keep the columns on age-group, sex, race, ethnicity, state fips code, symptom, if they were hospitalized or not, if they were admitted into ICU or not, and if they died or not.

# Data Sources

The data is sourced from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) website and includes over 27 million covid cases from the United States dating to January of last year to this month along with specific details about each case. The variables include: case month/year, state of residence, state FIPS code, county of residence, county FIPS code, age group, sex, race, ethnicity, survived or not, exposure, symptoms, and more.
